2. Enter: `https://smilemoore.co.uk/leaflet`
3. Customize with your brand blue: `#2563eb`
4. Download high-res PNG (1000x1000px minimum)
5. Add to your leaflet design

**Poster QR Code:**
1. Same process but use: `https://smilemoore.co.uk/poster`

## Comparing Campaign Performance:

In Google Analytics:
1. Go to **Reports** → **Engagement** → **Pages and screens**
2. Compare:
   - Which campaign gets most visitors?
   - Which has longest time on site?
   - Which leads to most email signups?
   - Which converts best to bookings?

This tells you which marketing materials work best!

## Pro Tips:

1. **Test before printing**: Visit each URL on your phone to make sure it works
2. **Short & memorable**: These URLs are easy to type if QR code doesn't work
3. **Track everything**: Every marketing material should have its own URL
4. **Review monthly**: Check which campaigns bring the most patients
5. **Update offers**: You can change the content on any page without changing the URL
